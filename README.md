# Multilingual_Online_Translator

The project was created to quickly translate unfamiliar words. The program works with 13 languages:
1. Arabic
2. German
3. English
4. Spanish
5. French
6. Hebrew
7. Japanese
8. Dutch
9. Polish
10. Portuguese
11. Romanian
12. Russian
13. Turkish
To translate from one language to all available, enter "all" as the second parameter.

In addition to the usual launch, the program can work with argv from the command line.
The source language is entered first, then the language into which you want to translate, and the word is written at the end.
